**Project area**: Analysis of cropping trends in Kansas landscapes

## Objective
The objective is to develop a multiple regression model for use to explain the relationship between planting of sorghum, dependent variable, with independent variables which may include; relative values of crop prices, rainfall, genetic gain in crop technologies, use of irrigation, and policies for risk managment like crop insurance. The scope is sorghum plantings in the cropping system of Kansas, with aim for county level analysis. The time horizon will be determined based on availability of compatible data sources but is anticipated to span from the 1990s to today.

## Outcomes
The outcomes will be two-fold. The first product will be the derived analysis of running, and fine-tuning the regression model (graphs, output anaylsis in csv, and if appropriate a map of results). The second product, will be the aligning data tools (equations, data storage and manipulation, and code) for use in future applications of exploring causal relationships between independent variables and the dependent variable of acres planted for a given crop. 

## Rationale
Knowledge of the driving determinates guiding farmer plantings presents insights to underpin strategies for investing in the advancement of mid-small range crops. Illustrated in Figure 1. is the rapid decline of diversity in cropping mix for Kansas cropping systems. This trend begs the question of what can be done to incent an increase in the diversity of the types of crops grown by farmers in Kansas.

## Methods ##
The mathmatical approach will be a regression, most likely linear. </br>
Y = Sorghum plantings in acres. SOURCE. USDA NASS </br>
B1 = Deviation of basis price from 3 year average. SOURCE. KSU Ag Manager </br> 
B2 = Deviation of basis price form 3 year average of substitute. SOURCE. KSU Ag Manager </br>
B3 = Ground water use SOURCE. KDA </br>
B4 = Soil moisture profile or pre-season rail fall. SOURCE.KSU Mesonet </br>
B5 = Use of Y exclusion for crop insurance. SOURCE. RMA, student will need to confirm accept to data <br/>
E = Random error term </br>
Note. The effect of variables will be evaluated for use as a predictor with subsequent fine tuning in the selection of independent variables.
